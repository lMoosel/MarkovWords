# MarkovWords
Generates new "words" in different languages using markov chains to pick the letters. Currently has English, German, and Hawaiian, Latin)

Currently Does not have text files for German/Hawaiian so the buttons are disabled

plan to add in support for more langs such as spanish or french. 
Might add a random button that generate a word then determines its origin (ex. English with German origin)
